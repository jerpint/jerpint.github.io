When I started my first real job as a programmer, the senior devs at the company all used vim. I was fascinated, and immediately hooked.

"You can edit text at the speed of thought" was the promise.

Though it might slow you down in the beginning, once you learned the intricacies of the key bindings, you could really power up your code editing. Yank these lines, delete those, macros, etc. It also made editing code more fun; less time wasted on mouse movements, muscle memory flowing through you with experience.

In many ways, I find we are now able to "code at the speed of thought". If there's a bug, I can fix the problem almost as quickly as I can explain it in words to my coding assistant. If that doesn't work? Try the next idea. Almost instant feedback. Same goes for a new feature. "Implement it just like we did with X, consider Y and Z when you do". Boom. It's there. Ready to review and ship. The code manifests almost as fast as I can think about it.
