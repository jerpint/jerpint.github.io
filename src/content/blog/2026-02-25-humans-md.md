description: A convention for the humans who read code

Most repos today have adopted the AGENTS.md convention (or in many cases CLAUDE.md). This is great — it's the entrypoint for agents to get up to speed and start building. Context about how to run tests, lint, build. What files live where. The stuff agents need to be effective.

We used to have README.md. Curated by humans, for humans.

The line between README.md and AGENTS.md is quickly blurring. README files are getting longer, more detailed, more machine-oriented. Instructions that no human would ever need to read are creeping in. The audience has shifted, and the document is following.

But we should still keep something intentional for the humans.

**HUMANS.md.**

Short and curated for the humans with limited eye span and long reading times. The stuff you actually want to communicate to a person sitting down to understand your project:

- What is this for?
- How do I get started?
- How does it work, at the level I need to think about?

Mermaid diagrams and charts. High-level architecture. Intent and motivation. The kind of thing that helps you build a mental model, not parse a config.

Leave the details to the agents. They're good at that — they'll consume whatever verbose, structured context you give them. But humans need something different. We need narrative. We need the "why" before the "how".

I've started doing this in my own tooling, e.g. [worktui](https://github.com/jerpint/worktui). A HUMANS.md that tells you what the project is about, how to think about it, and where to look — without drowning you in every flag and edge case.

Let's not become an afterthought in our own repos.
