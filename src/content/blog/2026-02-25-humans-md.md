We used to have `README.md` written by humans for humans. 
Today, most repos have adopted the `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` convention. 
It's the entrypoint for agents to get up to speed and start building.
It's usually written by agents, very detailed, and quickly tends to drift and get stale.

The line between `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` is quickly blurring.

> This is why I propose we start a new convention, `HUMANS.md`

It's pretty simple - the conventional `README.md` just points you to either file.
Here's an example from my latest project, [worktui](https://github.com/jerpint/worktui).

`HUMANS.md` should answer the important questions for the humans.
Short and curated for the readers with limited eye span and reading times. 
Mermaid diagrams and charts. 

High level instructions: what is this for and how do I get started. How does it work at the level I need to think about.
The rest you can point your own agents to and get more detail as you need it.


Let's not become an afterthought in our own repos!
