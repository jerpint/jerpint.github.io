Most repos today have adopted the AGENTS.md convention (or in many cases CLAUDE.md). This is very useful, it's the entrypoint for agents to get up to speed and start building.

We used to have README.md curated by humans for humans. The line between README.md and AGENTS.md is quickly blurring. But we should still keep HUMANS.md intentional.

Short and curated for the humans with limited eye span and long reading times. Mermaid diagrams and charts. High level instructions: what is this for and how do I get started. How does it work at the level I need to think about.

Leave the details to the agents, keep the intent alive.

An example of this is in my latest tooling e.g. [worktui](https://github.com/jerpint/worktui).

Let's not become an afterthought in our own repos!
