Each clock digit is generated by a [VAE](https://keras.io/examples/generative/vae/) trained on MNIST.
Every transition between digits traverses the latent space of the decoder, interpolating between digits.
To view how the digits themselves were generated, check out the [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jerpint/jerpint.github.io/blob/master/colabs/vae.ipynb).
Clock is in 24h format.
