With AI tools becoming increasingly capable, I've been building most of my tools to be agent-compatible. That means giving them the autonomy they need to accomplish the task I give them.

My blog is a perfect example of this. Each post is basically a markdown file with a bit of markup. It's auto-deployed on GitHub pages on every merge to main.

I'm currently writing this post directly in Claude Code mobile, from my phone, on the go. Then I just ask Claude to do the rest; create the post, push to a branch, then I push to main. It removes so much of the friction to create new posts. I no longer have to be at my computer. I just start a new conversation with Claude and it handles the annoying parts for me.

It's awesome!

— Update

While writing this post, I realized I could make my next post even faster, by getting Claude to add a CLAUDE.md to my repo and a skill for a new blog post, to have this be even more streamlined for next time.
