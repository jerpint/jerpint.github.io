My latest hands-off project was [Claudiobooks](https://claudiobooks.vercel.app/). It makes short-form AI-narrated podcasts grounded on public domain books. It comes with an RSS feed so you can stream directly in a podcast app and know when new episodes come out.

The internet is a fantastic playground and it's awesome that it's becoming easier for anybody to build on it.
