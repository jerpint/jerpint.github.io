description: Reflections on how AI coding agents have changed the way I write code and contribute to our company repo.

I can't remember the last time I typed a line of code in our company repo myself. It must have been in end of 2025 or so. At the same time, I've never contributed more to the repo since I've stopped writing the actual code.

I think there's an interesting experiment to be made. If you attached a keylogger to my computer, would you count me  entering more or less keystrokes since agents?  Would each entry contain more or less information density ?

My hypothesis is that each line I write today is 10x more information dense than the code I used to write. I can also produce it 10x faster since I don't need to worry about syntax and grammar.  It also tends to be 10x more ambiguous- hence the need to still verify if the coding agents translate my information inputs to code outputs.


There's a contradiction there- if I'm not writing the code than what role do I serve? is the code the contribution , or the ideas behind it?

I have the stereotypical workflow- 5+ claude code instances working in parallel, each on their own tasks, firing away.

I have never seen a single line of our automatically generated machine code. I have no idea where the code we ship actually gets served in production (some data center somewhere). Yet I know these systems well enough to know what they can do and what I can trust about them. Once configured, they work for me. Some need attention, some are abstractions you never even think of anymore.
