title: Would You Vibe Code a Building?
---

Building IKEA furniture and vibe coding have a lot in common.

## The Condo

Let's start simple. You want a small condo. You don't need to build it yourself - you can just rent one. There are plenty on the market. Cloud providers have you covered.

Now you need some furniture. Just head to IKEA and grab what you need. And if you don't want to assemble it yourself? Hire a Task Rabbit. Quick, cheap, done.

This is vibe coding at its finest. Prompt, ship, repeat.

## The Building

What if you want something bigger? A whole building?

Well, the infrastructure itself - you can still rent that. Cloud providers again. But now it gets expensive if you don't pick the right building in the right location.

And then the requirements start piling up...

Can that rack handle a 300 lb load? Some doors need to be waterproof. Some walls need to be soundproof - but for specific frequencies. The door at the main entrance? It's going to be opened 1000 times a day and needs to be up to code, or you're looking at serious fines.

You'll need hundreds of bathrooms. A kitchen for staff. Maybe a cafeteria?

Would you Task Rabbit that?

## The Question

At some point, the IKEA model breaks down. At some point, you need an architect. An engineer. Someone who understands load-bearing walls and fire codes and egress requirements.

At some point, you can't just vibe it.

So... would you vibe code a building?
