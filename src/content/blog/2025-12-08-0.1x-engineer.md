title: The Rise of the 0.1x Engineer
---

With the rise of coding assistants, anyone can become a **10x engineer**: 

- It's really easy to prompt a model to add code to a codebase. 
- It's really easy to add bloat to a codebase. 
- It's really easy to spaghettify a codebase 

I suspect we soon will start looking for **0.1x engineers**:

- It's really hard to have reusable code blocks and patterns. 
- It's really hard to differentiate dead code from LLM slop leftovers.
- It's really hard to group files intelligently. 

We've celebrated 10x engineers in the past - people who could type at the speed of thought. 
I suspect we will soon start celebrating the 0.1x engineers; those who don't prompt right away but carefully curate the code and set the right patterns.
