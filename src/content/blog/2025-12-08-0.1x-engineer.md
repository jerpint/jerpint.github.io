title: The rise of the 0.1x engineer
---

With the rise of coding assistants, everyone can become the proverbial "10x engineer". It's really easy to add code to a codebase. It's really easy to add bloat to a codebase. It's really easy to spaghettify a codebase.

I suspect we soon will start looking for "0.1x engineers". It's really hard to identify dead code in a codebase. It's really hard to have reusable code blocks and patterns. It's really hard to have functions that do one thing and one thing only. It's really hard to group files intelligently. It's really hard to delete files that aren't needed.

We've celebrated 10x engineers in the past. People who could type at the speed of thought. I suspect we will soon start celebrating the 0.1x engineers - those who don't prompt right away but carefully curate the code and set the right patterns.
