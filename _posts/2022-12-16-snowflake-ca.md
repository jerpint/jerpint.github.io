## Making Snowflakes

Arguably, the most famous Cellular Automata (CA) is [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
What's interesting is that we can slightly modify the rules to generate snowlakes!

In the original CA, we work on a square grid and assume each cell to have 8 neighbors.
For our snowflake, we will work on a hexagonal lattice and assume each cell to have 6 neighbors.

We will be using the `odd-r` representation to represent our lattice (see this wonderful [post](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#conversions) for more info).
This allows us to use a regular array and simply "convert" the representation to a hexagonal grid.

To get a cell's neighboring cell coordinates, we can then simply implement the following function:

```python
def get_adjacent_cells(i, j):
  """Given a position i,j, get all adjacent neighbors on hexagonal grid."""
  if j % 2 == 0:
    adjacent_cells =  (i-1, j-1), (i, j-1), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i-1, j+1), (i, j+1)
  else:
    adjacent_cells =  (i, j-1), (i+1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j+1)
  return adjacent_cells
```


We then need to define an update rule for our snowflake CA. We keep track of two states: 

* `"ice": 1`
* `"melted": 0`


To define an update, we simply count the number of "icy" and "melted" neighbors for a given cell and decide what should then happen:

Here's an example set of rules:

```python
if sum(neighbors) == 1:
    snowflake[i, j] = 1
elif sum(neighbors) == 2:
    snowflake[i, j] = 0
elif sum(neighbors) == 3:
    snowflake[i, j] = 0
elif sum(neighbors) == 4:
    snowflake[i, j] = 1
elif sum(neighbors) == 5:
    snowflake[i, j] = 1
elif sum(neighbors) == 6:
    snowflake[i, j] = 0
```

Now we can simply iterate over this and generate pretty snowflakes!
