Iâ€™m an applied research scientist with a focus on pragmatic applications of deep-learning to real-world data. 
I have over 7 years of industry experience designing, implementing and deploying deep-learning pipelines from the
ground up. 

I have a strong background in computer vision and have worked extensively with LLMs and multimodal architectures in the last few years. 
My programming language of choice is Python.
